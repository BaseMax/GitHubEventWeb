                                Enterprise: tailored for senior leaders and decision-makers from global companies interested in transformation, security, scalability, and productivity.
                                Univers(ity): designed specifically for college students seeking the tools, techniques, and connections that will help expand their resumes and prepare them for their future.
                                Play: take a break, get inspired, or discover something new with entertaining performances, tutorials, and unexpected stories, all driven by code.
                                And Universe is flexible - you can focus on one channel, or decide to pick-and-choose sessions that are most interesting and relevant to you across the program. All talks will require basic software understanding, there will not be entry-level sessions.

                                GitHub Discussions is a product feature we rolled out at GitHub Satellite. It’s a tool developers are encouraged to use to improve their workflows—and we will be using it for community conversations throughout the event.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Discussions live in your project repository, so they’re accessible where your community is already working together. Their threaded format makes it easy to start, respond to, and organize unstructured conversations. Questions can be marked as answered, so over time a community’s knowledge base grows naturally. And because discussions aren’t closed the way issues are, they can easily serve as a place for maintaining FAQs and other collaborative documentation. We recognize that community discussion is as much a part of development as coding, so discussion contributions appear in users’ contribution graphs.
                            </p>
